#Draw

This is a program that uses computer vision to draw on the screen. 

To use this program, choose a color, and it will track that color with the webcam. The on-screen canvas will (theoretically) trace the movements of objects of the chosen color. 

This program supports red, green, blue, purple, yellow, cyan, orange, and pink. To choose a color, type the first letter of the color. Use 'i' for pink.

The code is extremely messy right now, because I combined multiple other projects together into this. The next version of this program will be significantly cleaner.
